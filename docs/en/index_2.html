			<h2>IV. Clinical Characteristics</h2><h3>1. Clinical manifestations</h3><p>Based on the current  epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is one to 14 days,  mostly three to seven days.</p><p>Main manifestations include  fever, fatigue and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat,  myalgia and diarrhea are found in a few cases. Severe cases mostly developed  dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after one week. In severe cases, patients progress rapidly  to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis that  is difficult to correct, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and others. It  is worth noting that for severe and critically ill patients, their fever  could be moderate to low, or even barely noticeable.</p><p>Some children and neonatal cases  may have atypical symptoms, manifested as gastrointestinal symptoms such as  vomiting and diarrhea, or only manifested as low spirits and shortness of  breath.</p><p>The patients with mild symptoms  did not develop pneumonia but only low fever and mild fatigue.</p><p>From current situations, most  patients have good prognosis and a small number of patients are critically  ill. The prognosis for the elderly and patients with chronic underlying  diseases is poor. The clinical course of pregnant women with NCP is similar to  that of patients of the same age. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.</p><h3>2. Laboratory tests</h3><h4>General findings</h4><p>In the early stages of the  disease, peripheral WBC count is normal or decreased and the lymphocyte count  decreases. Some patients see an increase in liver enzymes, lactate  dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle enzymes and myoglobin. Elevated troponin is seen  in some critically ill patients while most patients have elevated C-reactive  protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. In  severe cases, D-dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes  progressively decrease. Severe and critically ill patients often have  elevated inflammatory factors.</p><h4>Pathogenic and serological  findings</h4><p>(1) Pathogenic findings: Novel  coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum,  lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces and other specimens using  RT-PCR and/or NGS methods. It is more accurate if specimens from lower respiratory  tract (sputum or air tract extraction) are tested. The specimens should be  submitted for testing as soon as possible after collection.</p><p>(2) Serological findings: NCP  virus specific IgM becomes detectable around 3-5 days after onset; IgG  reaches a titration of at least 4-fold increase during convalescence compared  with the acute phase.</p><h3>3. Chest imaging</h3><p>In the early stage, imaging  shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, apparent in the  outer lateral zone of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging then shows  multiple ground glass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe  cases, pulmonary consolidation may occur while pleural effusion is rare.</p><h2>V. Case Definitions</h2><h3>1. Suspect cases</h3><p>Considering both the following  epidemiological history and clinical manifestations:</p><h4>Epidemiological history</h4><p>1.1.1 History of travel to or  residence in Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or in other communities where  cases have been reported within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease;</p><p>1.1.2 In contact with novel  coronavirus infected people (with positive results for the nucleic acid test)  within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease;</p><p>1.1.3 In contact with patients  who have fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding area,  or from communities where confirmed cases have been reported within 14 days  before the onset of the disease;</p><p>1.1.4 Clustered cases (2 or more  cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small area such families,  offices, schools etc within 2 weeks).</p><h4>Clinical manifestations</h4><p>1.2.1 Fever and/or respiratory  symptoms;</p><p>1.2.2 The aforementioned imaging  characteristics of NCP;</p><p>1.2.3 Normal or decreased WBC  count, normal or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset.</p><p>A suspect case has any of the  epidemiological history plus any two clinical manifestations or all three  clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history.</p><h3>2. Confirmed cases</h3><p>Suspect cases with one of the  following etiological or serological evidences:</p><p>2.1 Real-time fluorescent RT-PCR  indicates positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid;</p><p>2.2 Viral gene sequence is  highly homologous to known new coronaviruses.</p><p>2.3 NCP virus specific Ig M and  IgG are detectable in serum; NCP virus specific IgG is detectable or reaches  a titration of at least 4-fold increase during convalescence compared with  the acute phase.</p><h2>VI. Clinical Classification</h2><h3>1. Mild cases</h3><p>The clinical symptoms were mild,  and there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging.</p><h3>2. Moderate cases</h3><p>Showing fever and respiratory  symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia.</p><h3>3. Severe cases</h3><p>Adult cases meeting any of the  following criteria:</p><p>(1) Respiratory distress (≧30  breaths/ min);</p><p>(2) Oxygen saturation≤93% at  rest;</p><p>(3) Arterial partial pressure of  oxygen (PaO2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)≦300mmHg (l mmHg=0.133kPa).</p><p>In high-altitude areas (at an  altitude of over 1,000 meters above the sea level), PaO2/ FiO2 shall be  corrected by the following formula: PaO2/ FiO2 x[Atmospheric pressure  (mmHg)/760]</p><p>Cases with chest imaging that  showed obvious lesion progression within 24-48 hours >50% shall be managed  as severe cases.</p><p>Child cases meeting any of the  following criteria:</p><p>(1) Tachypnea (RR ≥ 60  breaths/min for infants aged below 2 months; RR ≥ 50 BPM for infants aged  2-12 months; RR ≥ 40 BPM for children aged 1-5 years, and RR ≥ 30 BPM for  children above 5 years old) independent of fever and crying;</p><p>(2) Oxygen saturation ≤ 92% on  finger pulse oximeter taken at rest;</p><p>(3) Labored breathing (moaning,  nasal fluttering, and infrasternal, supraclavicular and intercostal  retraction), cyanosis, and intermittent apnea;</p><p>(4) Lethargy and convulsion;</p><p>(5) Difficulty feeding and signs  of dehydration.</p><h3>4. Critical cases</h3><p>Cases meeting any of the  following criteria:</p><p>4.1 Respiratory failure and  requiring mechanical ventilation;</p><p>4.2 Shock;</p><p>4.3 With other organ failure  that requires ICU care.</p><h2>VII. Clinical early warning  indicators of severe and critical cases</h2><h3>1. Adults.</h3><p>1.1 The peripheral blood  lymphocytes decrease progressively;</p><p>1.2 Peripheral blood  inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and C-reactive proteins, increase  progressively;</p><p>1.3 Lactate increases  progressively;</p><p>1.4 Lung lesions develop rapidly  in a short period of time.</p><h3>2. Children.</h3><p>2.1 Respiratory rate increased;</p><p>2.2 Poor mental reaction and  drowsiness;</p><p>2.3 Lactate increases  progressively;</p><p>2.4 Imaging shows infiltration  on both sides or multiple lobes, pleural effusion or rapid progress of  lesions in a short period of time;</p><p>2.5 Infants under the age of 3  months who have either underlying diseases (congenital heart disease,  bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory tract deformity, abnormal hemoglobin,  and severe malnutrition, etc.) or immune deficiency or hypofunction (long-term  use of immunosuppressants).</p><h2>VIII. Differential Diagnosis</h2><p>1. The mild manifestations of  NCP need to be distinguished from upper respiratory tract infections caused  by other viruses.</p><p>2. NCP is mainly distinguished  from other known viral pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections such as  influenza virus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Especially for  suspect cases, methods such as rapid antigen detection and multiplex PCR  nucleic acid detection should be adopted as much as possible for detection of  common respiratory pathogens.</p><p>3. It should also be  distinguished from non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis,  dermatomyositis and organizing pneumonia.</p><h2>IX. Case Finding and Reporting</h2><p>Health professionals in medical  institutions of all types and at all levels, upon discovering suspect cases  that meet the definition, should immediately put them in single room for  isolation and treatment. If the cases are still considered as suspected after  consultation made by hospital experts or attending physicians, it should be  reported directly online within 2 hours; samples should be collected for new  coronavirus nucleic acid testing and suspect cases should be safely  transferred to the designated hospitals immediately. People who have been in  close contact with patients who have been confirmed of new coronavirus  infection are advised to perform new coronavirus pathogenic testing in a  timely manner, even though common respiratory pathogens are tested positive.</p><p>If two nucleic acid tests, taken  at least 24-hour apart, of a NCP suspect case are negative, and the NCP virus  specific IgM and IgG are negative after 7 days from onset, the suspect  diagnosis can be ruled out.</p>
