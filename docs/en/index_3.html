				<h2>X. Treatment</h2><h3>1. Treatment venue determined by  the severity of the disease</h3><p>1.1 Suspected and confirmed  cases should be isolated and treated at designated hospitals with effective  isolation, protection and prevention conditions in place. A suspect case  should be treated in isolation in a single room. Confirmed cases can be treated  in the same room.</p><p>1.2 Critical cases should be  admitted to ICU as soon as possible.</p><h3>2. General treatment</h3><p>2.1 Letting patients rest in bed  and strengthening support therapy; ensuring sufficient caloric intake for  patients; monitoring their water and electrolyte balance to maintain internal  environment stability; closely monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation.</p><p>2.2 According to patients’  conditions, monitoring blood routine result, urine routine result, c-reactive  protein (CRP), biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal  function etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, chest  imaging and cytokines detection if necessary.</p><p>2.3 Timely providing effective  oxygen therapy, including nasal catheter and mask oxygenation and nasal  high-flow oxygen therapy. If possible, inhalation of mixed hydrogen and  oxygen (H2/O2: 66.6%/33.3%) can be applied.</p><p>2.4 Antiviral therapy: Hospitals  can try Alpha-interferon (5 million U or equivalent dose each time for  adults, adding 2ml of sterilized water, atomization inhalation twice daily),  lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/50mg per pill for adults, two pills each time,  twice daily, no longer than 10 days), Ribavirin (suggested to be used jointly  with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir, 500 mg each time for adults, twice or  three times of intravenous injection daily, no longer than 10 days),  chloroquine phosphate (500 mg bid for 7 days for adults aged 18-65 with body  weight over 50 kg; 500 mg bid for Days 1&2 and 500 mg qd for Days 3-7 for  adults with body weight below 50 kg), Arbidol (200 mg tid for adults, no  longer than 10 days). Be aware of the adverse reactions, contraindications  (for example, chloroquine cannot be used for patients with heart diseases)  and interactions of the above-mentioned drugs. Further evaluate the efficacy  of those drugs currently being used. Using three or more antiviral drugs at  the same time is not recommend; if an intolerable toxic side effect occurs,  the respective drug should be discontinued. For the treatment of pregnant  women, issues such as the number of gestational weeks, choice of drugs having  the least impact on the fetus, as well as whether pregnancy being terminated  before treatment should be considered with patients being informed of these  considerations.</p><p>2.5 Antibiotic drug treatment:  Blind or inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs should be avoided, especially  in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p><h3>3. Treatment of severe and  critical cases</h3><h4>Treatment principle:</h4><p>On the basis of symptomatic  treatment, complications should be proactively prevented, underlying diseases  should be treated, secondary infections also be prevented, and organ function  support should be provided timely.</p><h4>Respiratory support:</h4><p>3.2.1 Oxygen therapy: Patients  with severe symptoms should receive nasal cannulas or masks for oxygen  inhalation and timely assessment of respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia  should be performed.</p><p>3.2.2 High-flow nasal-catheter  oxygenation or noninvasive mechanical ventilation: When respiratory distress  and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving standard  oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non-invasive  ventilation can be considered. If conditions do not improve or even get worse  within a short time (1-2 hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical  ventilation should be used in a timely manner.</p><p>3.2.3 Invasive mechanical  ventilation: Lung protective ventilation strategy, namely low tidal volume  (6-8ml/kg of ideal body weight) and low level of airway platform pressure  (<30cmH2O) should be used to perform mechanical ventilation to reduce  ventilator-related lung injury. While the airway platform pressure maintained  ≤30cmH2O, high PEEP can be used to keep the airway warm and moist; avoid long  sedation and wake the patient early for lung rehabilitation. There are many  cases of human-machine asynchronization, therefore sedation and muscle  relaxants should be used in a timely manner. Use closed sputum suction  according to the airway secretion, if necessary, administer appropriate  treatment based on bronchoscopy findings.</p><p>3.2.4 Rescue therapy: Pulmonary  re-tensioning is recommended for patients with severe ARDS. With sufficient  human resources, prone position ventilation should be performed for more than  12 hours per day. If the outcome of prone position ventilation is poor,  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as  possible. Indications include: ①When Fi02＞90%, the oxygenation index is less  than 80mmHg for more than 3-4 hours; ②For patients with only respiratory  failure when the airway platform pressure ≥ 35cmH2O, VV-ECMO mode is  preferred; if circulatory support is needed, VA-ECMO mode should be used.  When underlying diseases are under control and the cardiopulmonary function  shows signs of recovery, withdrawal of ECMO can be tried.</p><h4>Circulatory support:</h4><p>On the basis of adequate fluid  resuscitation, efforts should be made to improve microcirculation, use  vasoactive drugs, closely monitor changes in blood pressure, heart rate and  urine volume as well as lactate and base excess in arterial blood gas analysis.  If necessary, use non-invasive or invasive hemodynamic monitor such as  Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, invasive blood pressure or continuous  cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring. In the process of treatment, pay attention  to the liquid balance strategy to avoid excessive or insufficient fluid  intake.</p><p>If the heart rate suddenly  increases more than 20% of the basic value or the decrease of blood pressure  is more than 20% of the basic value with manifestations of poor skin  perfusion and decreased urine volume, make sure to closely observe whether  the patient has septic shock, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or heart failure.</p><h4>Renal failure and renal  replacement therapy:</h4><p>Active efforts should be made to  look for causes for renal function damage in critical cases such as low  perfusion and drugs. For the treatment of patients with renal failure, focus  should be on the balance of body fluid, acid and base and electrolyte balance,  as well as on nutrition support including nitrogen balance and the  supplementation of energies and trace elements. For critical cases,  continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used. The indications  include: ① hyperkalemia; ② acidosis; ③ pulmonary edema or water overload;  ④fluid management in multiple organ dysfunction.</p><h4>Convalescent plasma  treatment:</h4><p>It is suitable for patients with  rapid disease progression, severe and critically ill patients. Usage and  dosage should refer to Protocol of Clinical Treatment with Convalescent  Plasma for NCP Patients (2nd trial version).</p><h4>Blood purification  treatment:</h4><p>Blood purification system  including plasma exchange,absorption, perfusion and blood/plasma filtration  can remove inflammatory factors and block cytokine storm, so as  to reduce the damage of inflammatory reactions to the body. It can be used for  the treatment of severe and critical cases in the early and middle stages of  cytokine storm.</p><h4>Immunotherapy:</h4><p>For patients with extensive lung  lesions and severe cases who also show an increased level of IL-6 in  laboratory testing, Tocilizumab can be used for treatment. The initial dose  is 4-8mg/kg with the recommended dose of 400mg diluted with 0.9% normal saline  to 100ml. The infusion time should be more than 1 hour. If the initial  medication is not effective, one extra administration can be given after 12  hours (same dose as before). No more than two administrations should be given  with the maximum single dose no more than 800mg. Watch out for allergic  reactions. Administration is forbidden for people with active infections such  as tuberculosis.</p><h4>Other therapeutic measures</h4><p>For patients with progressive  deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid progress in imaging and  excessive activation of the body's inflammatory response, glucocorticoids can  be used in a short period of time (three to five days). It is recommended that  dose should not exceed the equivalent of methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day.  Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of  coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects. Xuebijing 100ml/time can be  administered intravenously twice a day. Intestinal microecological regulators  can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balance and prevent  secondary bacterial infections.</p><p>Child severe and critical cases  can be given intravenous infusion of γ-globulin.</p><p>For pregnant severe and critical  cases, pregnancy should be terminated preferably with c-section.</p><p>Patients often suffer from  anxiety and fear and they should be supported by psychological counseling.</p><h2>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment</h2><p>The COVID-19 belongs to plague  in TCM with the etiology of epidemic factor exposure. Different regions can  refer to the following plans for syndrome differentiation and treatment,  according to the disease, local climate characteristics and different constitutions.
